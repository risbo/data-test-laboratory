Hereâ€™s a **simplified and combined list of core Git and GitHub Actions concepts**, ideal for developers, DevOps engineers, and teams working with version control and CI/CD pipelines.

---

## âœ… **Core Git Concepts**

### ðŸ”· **Version Control Basics**

* **Repository (repo)**: A project folder tracked by Git
* **Commit**: A snapshot of changes
* **Branch**: A separate line of development (`main`, `feature/login`)
* **Merge**: Integrating one branch into another
* **Rebase**: Rewriting commit history to keep it linear
* **Clone**: Download a repo
* **Pull**: Fetch and merge remote changes
* **Push**: Upload local commits to the remote repo
* **Status / Log / Diff**: Inspect working changes and history
* **Staging Area**: Files marked for the next commit

---

### ðŸ”· **Branching Strategies**

* **Git Flow**: `main`, `develop`, `feature`, `release`, `hotfix`
* **Trunk-based Development**: All developers work from `main`
* **Feature Branching**: Isolated development for new features
* **Pull Requests**: Propose changes before merging

---

### ðŸ”· **Collaboration**

* **Fork**: Create your own copy of a repo
* **Pull Request (PR)**: Request to merge your code into another branch/repo
* **Code Reviews & Comments**: Part of PR workflow
* **Issues & Labels**: Track bugs, tasks, and enhancements
* **Releases**: Tagged commits with versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

---

## âœ… **Core GitHub Actions Concepts**

### ðŸ”· **Workflows**

* **Workflow**: An automated process defined in `.github/workflows/`
* **Trigger Events**: `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`
* **Jobs**: A sequence of steps that run in the same environment
* **Steps**: Individual commands or actions (e.g., `run: npm install`)
* **Actions**: Reusable units of automation (`uses: actions/checkout@v3`)
* **Runners**: Virtual machines (Linux, Windows, macOS) that execute jobs

---

### ðŸ”· **Workflow Features**

* **Matrix Strategy**: Run tests in parallel for multiple versions (e.g., Java 8, 11, 17)
* **Secrets & Variables**: Store credentials securely (`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`)
* **Environment Protection Rules**: Manual approvals, constraints
* **Conditional Execution**: `if:` statements on jobs/steps
* **Artifacts**: Save and upload build/test files
* **Caching**: Speed up workflows (`actions/cache`)
* **Reusable Workflows**: DRY your CI/CD logic (`workflow_call`)

---

### ðŸ”· **Common Use Cases**

* **CI/CD**: Lint, test, build, deploy apps
* **Static Analysis & Security Scanning**
* **Docker Build & Push to Registry**
* **Publish NPM/Java/Python packages**
* **Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure/Firebase/Vercel**
