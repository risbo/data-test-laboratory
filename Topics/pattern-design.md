‚úÖ Design Patterns in Kotlin
üß± Creational Patterns
Singleton (object in Kotlin)
Factory Method (when, sealed classes, abstract creators)
Abstract Factory (for families of related objects)
Builder (chained DSL-style APIs, apply, with)
Prototype (copying objects using data class.copy())
üß© Structural Patterns
Adapter (wrap incompatible interfaces using delegation)
Decorator (enhance behavior via function wrapping or composition)
Composite (tree structures with unified interfaces)
Facade (simplify subsystems into a single interface)
Proxy (control access to an object using by delegation)
Bridge (separate abstraction from implementation)
‚öôÔ∏è Behavioral Patterns
Strategy (define interchangeable behaviors, often using lambdas or interfaces)
Observer (event/listener pattern, or Flow/StateFlow for reactive data)
Command (encapsulate actions as objects)
State (represent states as objects or enums with behavior)
Chain of Responsibility (pass request along handlers, often via recursion or chaining)
Mediator (centralized communication between objects)
Memento (save/restore state using copies or serialization)
Template Method (define a skeleton with overridable steps)
Iterator (traverse collections, often via Kotlin's native iterator())
üß† Concurrency-Related (Kotlin Specific)
Coroutine-based State Machines
Event Bus with SharedFlow or Channel
Producer‚ÄìConsumer using Flow and collect
