Here’s a **simplified and combined list of core Scrum concepts**, ideal for developers, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and teams adopting Agile frameworks for iterative software delivery.

---

## ✅ **Core Scrum Concepts**

---

### 🔷 **Scrum Roles**

* **Product Owner (PO)**
  Owns the product backlog, defines priorities, maximizes product value.

* **Scrum Master**
  Facilitates the process, removes blockers, coaches the team in Scrum principles.

* **Development Team**
  Cross-functional team responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment.

---

### 🔷 **Scrum Events (Ceremonies)**

* **Sprint**
  Time-boxed iteration (1–4 weeks), delivers a product increment.

* **Sprint Planning**
  Define sprint goal and select backlog items to deliver.

* **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**
  15-minute sync:
  “What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers?”

* **Sprint Review**
  Demonstrate what was done, gather feedback, inspect product increment.

* **Sprint Retrospective**
  Reflect and improve: “What went well? What can we improve?”

---

### 🔷 **Scrum Artifacts**

* **Product Backlog**
  Ordered list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

* **Sprint Backlog**
  Subset of backlog items selected for the current sprint, including tasks.

* **Increment**
  The working software that meets the **Definition of Done (DoD)**.

---

### 🔷 **Supporting Concepts**

* **User Stories**
  Feature descriptions from an end-user perspective (e.g., “As a user, I want...”)

* **Story Points / Estimation**
  Relative sizing of effort/complexity (Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...)

* **Definition of Done (DoD)**
  Agreement on what makes a story “done” (code, tests, review, deployable)

* **Burndown Chart**
  Visual tracking of remaining work in a sprint or release.

* **Velocity**
  Average number of story points completed per sprint — helps predict delivery.

---

### 🔷 **Agile Values & Principles (from the Agile Manifesto)**

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

---

### 🔷 **Anti-Patterns in Scrum**

* Fake Scrum (no real iteration, no reviews or retrospectives)
* Micromanaged stand-ups
* Ignoring feedback from sprint reviews
* Skipping retrospectives
* Treating Scrum as just a status reporting framework

Would you like a Scrum board template, or a sample backlog and sprint setup for a software project (e.g., API + frontend + CI)?
