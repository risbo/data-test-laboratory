Here’s a **simplified and combined list of core concepts for Software Security, Data Security, and Network Security**, ideal for developers, DevOps, architects, and security professionals to build secure applications and infrastructures.

## ✅ **Software, Data, and Network Security – Core Concepts Overview**

---

### 🛡️ **Software Security (AppSec)**

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to avoid injection attacks
* **Authentication & Authorization**: Use secure token-based systems (JWT, OAuth2)
* **Session Management**: Secure cookies, timeout, regeneration
* **Error Handling**: Avoid leaking internal errors or stack traces
* **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow OWASP Top 10 (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.)

#### 🔷 Practices

* Use **static code analysis** (SAST) tools like SonarQube, Semgrep
* Perform **code reviews with security checks**
* Implement **dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)

#### 🔷 Tools

* Spring Security (Java/Kotlin)
* Helmet.js (Node.js)
* CSRF tokens, rate limiters, CORS settings

---

### 🔐 **Data Security**

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* **Encryption**: At rest and in transit (AES, TLS)
* **Access Control**: Least privilege (RBAC/ABAC) for files and databases
* **Data Masking & Tokenization**: For PII/PHI protection
* **Backups and Recovery**: Regular, encrypted, and tested
* **Data Integrity**: Hashing (SHA-256, HMAC) and checksums

#### 🔷 Storage Security

* Database encryption (TDE, row-level)
* S3 bucket policies and encryption (SSE, KMS)
* Avoid storing plaintext credentials or tokens

#### 🔷 Compliance Standards

* GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS
* Use DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems in enterprise settings

---

### 🌐 **Network Security**

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* **Firewalls**: Network-level filtering (iptables, security groups, WAFs)
* **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
* **TLS/SSL**: Mandatory for all web traffic
* **VPN and Tunneling**: Encrypted remote access
* **Port Management**: Close unused ports; scan regularly

#### 🔷 Cloud Networking

* Secure VPC design (subnets, routing, NAT, bastion hosts)
* Identity-aware proxy (IAP) for access to private services
* DNS hardening and protection against DNS spoofing

#### 🔷 Monitoring & Intrusion Detection

* **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion detection/prevention systems
* **SIEM**: Log aggregation and analysis (e.g., Splunk, CloudWatch)
* **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield, Cloudflare, etc.

---

## 🔁 **Cross-Cutting Practices**

* **Security by Design**: Integrate security from the start (not patch later)
* **DevSecOps**: Embed security in CI/CD pipelines
* **Penetration Testing**: Regular ethical hacking to identify weaknesses
* **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE, DREAD, or attack trees
* **Security Awareness Training**: For all team members
