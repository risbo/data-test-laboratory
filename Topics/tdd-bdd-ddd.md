Here’s a **simplified and combined list of core concepts for TDD, BDD, and DDD**, tailored for developers, architects, and QA engineers aiming for better software quality, collaboration, and domain clarity.

## ✅ **TDD | BDD | DDD – Core Concepts Overview**

---

### 🧪 **TDD – Test-Driven Development**

> **"Red → Green → Refactor"**: Write tests first, then code to pass them, then improve the design.

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* Write unit tests **before** implementation
* Use small, fast tests focused on one responsibility
* Refactor only when tests pass
* Repeat the cycle frequently

#### 🔷 Practices & Tools

* JUnit (Java), Kotest (Kotlin), PyTest (Python), etc.
* Mocking libraries: Mockito, MockK
* Use of CI to run tests frequently

#### 🔷 Anti-Patterns

* Writing tests after the code
* Testing implementation details
* Ignoring test failures ("flaky" tests)
* Poor naming and lack of test structure

---

### 🤝 **BDD – Behavior-Driven Development**

> **"Given–When–Then"**: Define the system's behavior from a user's perspective.

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* Focus on **business outcomes and scenarios**
* Use **natural language** to describe behaviors
* Collaborative: involves **devs + testers + product owners**

#### 🔷 Tools

* Cucumber, JBehave, SpecFlow
* Gherkin syntax (`Feature`, `Scenario`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`)
* Step definitions linked to test code

#### 🔷 Benefits

* Improved communication
* Living documentation
* Validates requirements early

#### 🔷 Anti-Patterns

* Too technical scenarios
* Over-mocking behavior
* Treating BDD as just a test framework, not a collaboration tool

---

### 🧠 **DDD – Domain-Driven Design**

> **"Focus on the core domain and domain logic."**

#### 🔷 Core Concepts

* **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared language between devs and domain experts
* **Bounded Contexts**: Isolate models in different subdomains
* **Aggregates**: Group of related objects treated as one unit
* **Entities & Value Objects**: Objects with identity vs objects with only value
* **Domain Events**: Captures events that happen within the domain
* **Repositories**: Abstract access to aggregates/entities

#### 🔷 Architectural Practices

* Hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters)
* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
* Event Sourcing

#### 🔷 Benefits

* Better alignment between code and business logic
* Strategic modeling and modularity
* Clear separation of concerns

#### 🔷 Anti-Patterns

* Anemic domain model (data-only classes)
* Mixing business logic with infrastructure
* Ignoring bounded contexts
* Premature overengineering

| Aspect    | TDD                  | BDD                        | DDD                            |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Focus     | Correctness of code  | Behavior and collaboration | Domain logic and structure     |
| Driven by | Developer            | Cross-functional team      | Domain experts + architects    |
| Language  | Code/test            | Natural language (Gherkin) | Ubiquitous language            |
| Tools     | JUnit, Mockito, etc. | Cucumber, SpecFlow, etc.   | Strategic modeling, aggregates |
| Output    | Tested, working code | Verified business behavior | Aligned software model         |
